Menyou is being created out of an interest in improving the consumer dining experience. There are
many platforms out there to help the user decide where to eat - facilitating the discovery of new
venues and aggregating reviews and ratings for comparison purposes. There are fewer apps though
which deal with the experience of arriving at a restaurant and not knowing what to order. Have you
ever been to a restaurant and ordered “your standard” favorite dish because you did not want to
make a mistake by ordering something new and not liking it? Menyou will assist in choosing what
food to order!This applicationis based on a combination of analyzing the user’s mood and preference
inputs, displaying their friends and personal reviews of the restaurant’s offerings, and providing
a well-organized list of what is available to them. Menyou will help consumers make food ordering a
more informed and enjoyable experience.
